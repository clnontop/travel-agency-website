# ✅ Driver App is Running Successfully!

## 🎉 Server is Live!

The Expo development server is running at:
```
exp://192.168.0.189:8081
```

## 📱 How to Test on Your Phone NOW:

### Step 1: Install Expo Go
- **Android**: Search "Expo Go" in Play Store
- **iOS**: Search "Expo Go" in App Store

### Step 2: Scan the QR Code
1. Open **Expo Go** app on your phone
2. Tap **"Scan QR Code"**
3. Scan the QR code shown in your terminal
4. Wait for app to load (first time takes 30-60 seconds)

### Step 3: Test the App
You'll see:
- **Driver Dashboard** with Trinck branding
- **Online/Offline Toggle** - Tap to change status
- **Earnings Display** - Shows ₹0 (test data)
- **Location Status** - Shows if location is being shared
- **Test Credentials** displayed at bottom

## 🔧 What's Working:

✅ **Simplified App Version** - No navigation errors
✅ **Basic UI** - Clean dashboard interface  
✅ **Status Toggle** - Online/Offline functionality
✅ **Location Indicator** - Shows tracking status
✅ **Expo Server** - Running on port 8081

## 📍 Important Notes:

1. **API Connection**: The app is configured to connect to `http://192.168.1.6:3000/api`
   - Make sure your main website is running (`npm run dev`)
   - If API calls fail, update the IP in ApiService.ts

2. **Location Tracking**: 
   - When "Online", location will be sent to server
   - No map shown in app (as requested)
   - Customers see location on website

3. **Test Account**:
   ```
   Email: rajesh.kumar@example.com
   Password: driver123
   ```

## 🚀 Next Steps:

### To Add Full Navigation:
Once basic app works, we can add navigation back:
```bash
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack --legacy-peer-deps
```

### To Build APK:
```bash
# Option 1: Expo Build
expo build:android -t apk

# Option 2: EAS Build  
eas build -p android --profile preview
```

### To Customize:
1. Replace icons in `assets/` folder
2. Update colors in App.tsx styles
3. Add your logo/branding
4. Modify API endpoints
