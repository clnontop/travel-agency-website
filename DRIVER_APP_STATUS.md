## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Update API URL

For the app to work on your phone, you need to update the API URL:

1. **Find your computer's IP address:**
   ```bash
   ipconfig
   ```
   Look for "IPv4 Address" (something like 192.168.1.100)

2. **Update these files:**
   - `driver-app/src/services/ApiService.ts`
   - `driver-app/src/services/AuthService.ts`

   Change:
   ```javascript
   const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3000/api';
   ```
   
   To:
   ```javascript
   const API_BASE_URL = 'http://YOUR_IP:3000/api';
   ```

3. **Restart the app** (press 'r' in terminal)

## 📦 Building APK

When you're ready to create an APK file:

### Option 1: Quick Build (Expo Classic)
```bash
cd driver-app
expo build:android -t apk
```
- Creates APK on Expo servers
- Takes 15-30 minutes
- Get download link when done

### Option 2: EAS Build (Recommended)
```bash
cd driver-app
eas build -p android --profile preview
```
- More control over build
- Better for production
- Requires Expo account

### Option 3: Run Build Script
```bash
cd driver-app
build-apk-simple.bat
```
- Automated build process
- Guides you through steps

## 📍 How Location Tracking Works

1. **Driver logs in** → App connects to server
2. **Goes online** → Location tracking starts
3. **Every 10 seconds** → Sends GPS coordinates to website
4. **Customer books** → Can see driver location on website map
5. **Goes offline** → Location tracking stops

**Note:** No map is shown in the driver app - location only appears on website!

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### App won't connect?
- Make sure main website is running (`npm run dev`)
- Check IP address in API files
- Phone and computer must be on same WiFi

### Location not working?
- Enable location permissions
- Turn on GPS
- Allow "Always" permission for background

### Build failed?
- Run `npm install` first
- Make sure you have Expo account
- Check internet connection
