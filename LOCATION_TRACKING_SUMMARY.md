## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Implementation**

### **API Endpoints Created:**
```
POST /api/driver/location          # Driver sends location updates
GET  /api/driver/location          # Customer gets driver location
GET  /api/bookings/active          # Get active bookings for user
GET  /api/bookings/customer/active # Get customer's active booking
```

### **Database Integration:**
- Uses existing `Booking` and `User` tables
- Real-time location stored in memory for performance
- Privacy checks against active bookings
- JWT authentication for all requests

### **Real-time Updates:**
- **Driver side**: Sends GPS every 30 seconds when online
- **Customer side**: Fetches location every 10 seconds
- **Connection monitoring**: Shows online/offline status
- **Auto-retry**: Handles network failures gracefully
